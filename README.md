## Project Objective
The objective of this Tableau project was to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report that provides insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. 
The project aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making, track the bank's lending activities and performance, and identify trends to inform lending strategies.

## Problem Statement
The project addresses the following problem statements:
1. Creation of a comprehensive Bank Loan Report to monitor and assess lending activities and performance.
2. Identification and visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios.
3. Differentiation between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria.
4. Implementation of various chart types to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends, including line charts, filled maps, donut charts, bar charts, and treemaps.

## Actions Taken
1. Data collection: Gathered loan data including application details, funded amounts, loan statuses, borrower profiles, and other relevant information.
2. Data preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the loan data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. Dashboard creation: Developed three dashboards - Summary, Overview, and Details - to provide a comprehensive view of loan-related metrics and trends.
4. Implemented visualizations: Utilized various chart types such as line charts, filled maps, donut charts, bar charts, and treemaps to represent loan data effectively.

## Dashboards Made
1. **Summary Dashboard**: Provides an overview of key loan-related metrics and KPIs, including total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, average interest rate, and average debt-to-income ratio. Distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific criteria.
2. **Overview Dashboard**: Visualizes critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types, including line charts, filled maps, donut charts, bar charts, and treemaps. Offers insights into monthly trends, regional analysis, loan term analysis, employee length analysis, loan purpose breakdown, and home ownership analysis.
3. **Details Dashboard**: Offers a consolidated view of all essential loan data points, enabling users to access detailed insights into the loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

## Results and Conclusion
The Tableau project successfully addresses the problem statements by providing comprehensive visualizations of key loan-related metrics and trends. The dashboards offer valuable insights into lending activities, loan performance, borrower profiles, and regional disparities. The project enables data-driven decision-making, supports strategic planning within lending operations, and facilitates efficient access to critical loan data.
